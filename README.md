BloomAPI is a set of libraries and executables to translate existing datasources into performant APIs. A public deployment of BloomAPI as well as more information can be found at http://www.bloomapi.com.

The public deployment of BloomAPI currently hosts an updated mirror of the [NPI Data Dissemination](http://nppes.viva-it.com/NPI_Files.html) as an example, but production ready, datasource.

### Roadmap
- Improve API search capabilities based on existing needs and usage
- Improve libraries to make introducing new datasources an easy, well documented, process
- Include easy to use, data documentation tools
- Include useful public datasets out of the box such as NUCC Taxonomy Codes, Geo-coded locations in existing data sets (E.g. NPI), ICD-9/10 codes, UPIN crosswalk, and FDA's NDC.
- Also include data loading code for datasets with licensing restrictions such as AHRQ's HCUP data and CPT codes.
